					<h3>Gary Baker #11</h3>
					<h4>Inducted May 2010</h4>
					<p></p>
					<p></p>
					<p>Gary Baker became the first inductee to the Louisiana Tech Hockey Hall of Fame after the inaugural season. 
						Gary was the first ever hockey alumnus and has since served as the first ever coach for Louisiana Tech Hockey. 
						In his first season as coach, he was selected as the Asst. Coach for the 2012 SCHL All-Stars, and lead La Tech Hockey to the playoffs. 
						Gary has played a pivotal role in the creation and running of the team and has continued to contribute his efforts toward the program. 
						It is only fitting that his #11 jersey was retired.</p>
					<p></p>
					<h3>Kevin Fontenot #26</h3>
					<h4>Inducted May 2011</h4>
					<p></p>
					<p></p>
					<p>Kevin Fontenot became the first ever SCHL Rookie of the Year. It was also the first ever Rookie of the Year award given in the NCHRA, setting 
						the standard for what a Louisiana Tech Hockey player should strive for. This achievement lead to Kevin Fontenot becoming the second inductee 
						to the Louisiana Tech Hockey Hall of Fame.</p>
					<p></p>	
					<h3>Cole Luse #9</h3>
					<h4>Inducted April 2013</h4>
					<p></p>
					<p></p>
					<p>Cole Luse was inducted into the Louisiana Tech Hockey Hall of Fame as the original founder of the program. Cole got the team to be a recognized Club 
						Sport in the 2008 school year, laying the ground work for the future program. As a player he served as an Alternate Captain for three seasons, as well 
						as making the SCHL All Stars three seasons. If not for Cole's vision Louisiana Tech Hockey may not exist today. It is these reasons why his #9 jersey was retired.</p>
					<p></p>	
					<h3>Michael Hinton #29</h3>
					<h4>Inducted April 2013</h4>
					<p></p>
					<p></p>
					<p>Michael Hinton was the secondary founder of the program. He took what Cole Luse set up and created a program and entered it into the SCHL (Southwest Collegiate Hockey League). 
						He led the team into its Inaugural season in 2009-2010 and served as the goalie for the first three seasons. He made two SCHL All Star teams, and in his senior season was given 
						the 2012 NCRHA's Outstanding Contribution to Collegiate Roller Hockey Award. After graduation he became the Director of Club Development for the SCHL, as well as serving as coach 
						for Louisiana Tech Hockey. It is for all his contributions that his #29 jersey was retired.</p>
